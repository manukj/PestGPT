\chapter*{\Large \center Abstract}

Effective pest control has become vital in modern agriculture to maintain crop health and yield.This research project aims to create a novel, user-friendly system that streamlines pest identification and management for farmers by incorporating modern technology. By implementing a secure registration and login system, farmers can easily access the platform and manage their profiles. In order to identify pests accurately and quickly, the system makes use of Machine Learning models that are trained on a large dataset.
Additionally the system provides more details on the pest detected which is backed by a knowledge graph database or a large language model similar to ChatGPT and recommend Pesticides. To enable the purchase of suggested pesticides, a decentralised (peer-to-peer) payment mechanism using blockchain is also included, guaranteeing safe and decentralised transactions.By providing fast, accurate, and feasible pest management solutions, this comprehensive approach not only assists farmers with effective pest control but also encourages sustainable agricultural practices. The integration of modern technology into this system signifies a notable progression in agricultural aid tools, with the potential to enhance farming communities' sustainability and production.
